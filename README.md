# The Red Call - An Amazing Project

This Red Cross project concerns volunteers that do social activities (roams, emergency night shelters...) and those who do first aid. As volunteers can be located anywhere in Paris (or elsewhere), tools are required to synchronize people as fast as possible when criticial situations occur.

RedCall.io is a messaging tool for head of emergencies. They use it to ask for volunteer's availability, gather volunteer's answers, and fill up ambulances or assistance units with the required people and skills.
